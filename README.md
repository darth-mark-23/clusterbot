# ClusterBot

ClusterBot leverages OpenAI's "Assistants" feature to create a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem of AI-driven agents. These Assistants can communicate, collaborate, and execute custom actions within a publisher-subscriber model known as "Clusters". Each Assistant can be customized with specific instructions, documents, and API actions to fulfill its role within the system.

## Overview

Think of ClusterBot as a virtual office space, where each worker (Assistant) has access to a bulletin board (Cluster). Workers can post notices (publish) or read up on the latest news (subscribe) pertinent to their roles. Our virtual office (the system of Clusters) maintains an organized and efficient flow of information, ensuring all Assistants are up-to-date and aligned in their objectives.

## How it Works

### Assistants

Assistants are individual AI agents created through OpenAI's API. Each Assistant is programmed with unique capabilities and can carry out tasks autonomously or in collaboration with other Assistants. They can subscribe to specific Clusters to receive information or publish their own messages to share insights and completed tasks.

### Clusters

Clusters are the communication backbone of the system, acting as specialized channels for information exchange. Assistants can publish to or subscribe from Clusters, allowing for a modular and scalable approach to AI-driven communication and task management.
